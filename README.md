# Let me introduce myself!

- 👋 Hi, I’m @syrenly.
- 🌸 I'm a frontend developer, with focus on Angular.
- 🌱 I'm trying to create projects with Angular on GitHub, to improve my skills.
- 🥰 I like to share knowledge and learn new stuff.
- 🤗 You are welcome to stay here and study with me 🤗

# My repositories

A brief summary of all my repositories. Further details can be found in the specific README of each repository. Any constructive suggestions are REALLY REALLY REALLY appreciated. 

## Development

💪 My current efforts are on:
- 🚧angular-demo🚧: application to study Angular 17. Be careful, it's a work in progress; take one of these: ⛑️ ⛑️ ⛑️

 Maybe not the most aesthetically pleasing projects you will ever see on Github, but at least they do what they should do:
- angular-w-bootstrap: small application to test integrations with Bootstrap CSS framework and study Angular attributes and directives to apply styles. Unit tests included.
- angular-w-tailwind: small application to test integrations with Tailwind CSS framework and DaisyUI.
- microfrontend: demo application with dynamic loading of microfrontend applications.

Others:
- training-ground: not a real project, but a repo containing my notes and experiments while studying. Probably I will keep this private.
- new repositories soon 😊

## Personal interests

- 🎲 GURPS: a set of RPG rules from GURPS system, to be used in couple with "The Silence of Hollowind" settings.
