- 👋 Hi, I’m @syrenly
- 🌸 I'm a frontend developer, with focus on Angular.
- 🧞 Actually, my current job is more about finding solutions than developing.
- 🌱 For this reason, I'm trying to create projects with Angular on GitHub.
- 🥰 I like to share knowledge and learn new stuff.
- 👻 I can't stand bully developers.
