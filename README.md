# Let me introduce myself!

- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m **syrenly**.
- ðŸŒ¸ I'm a frontend developer, with focus on Angular.
- ðŸŒ± I'm trying to create projects with Angular on GitHub, to improve my skills.
- ðŸ¥° I like to share knowledge and learn new stuff.
- ðŸ¤— You are welcome to stay here and study with me ðŸ¤—

# My repositories

A brief summary of all my repositories. Further details can be found in the specific README of each repository. The applications are implemented with Angular framework, possibly at the latest version. Any constructive suggestions are REALLY REALLY REALLY appreciated.

## Development

ðŸ’ª My current efforts are on:
- ðŸŽ‰ Upgrading almost all repos to Angular 18 ðŸŽ‰

Full applications:
- weather-forecast: a demo application, that uses OpenWeatherAPI to retrieve data about weather forecasts. Unit tests cover at least 80% of the code.
  - [Repository](https://github.com/syrenly/weather-forecast)
  - [Deployed application](https://syrenly.github.io/weather-forecast/home)

Maybe not the most aesthetically pleasing projects you will ever see on Github, but at least they do what they should do:
- angular-w-bootstrap: small application to test integrations with Bootstrap CSS framework and study Angular attributes and directives to apply styles. Unit tests included.
- angular-w-tailwind: small application to test integrations with Tailwind CSS framework and DaisyUI. Unit tests included.

Others:
- training-ground: not a real project, but a repo containing my notes and experiments while studying. Probably I will keep this private.
- new repositories soon ðŸ˜Š

## Personal interests

- ðŸŽ² GURPS: a set of RPG rules adapted from GURPS system, to be used in couple with "The Silence of Hollowind" settings.
