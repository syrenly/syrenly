# Let me introduce myself!

- 🤗 You are welcome to stay here and study with me 🤗

# My repositories

A brief summary of all my repository. Any suggestions are REALLY appreciated 

## Development

 Maybe not the most aesthetically pleasing projects you will ever see on Github, but at least they do what they should do:
 
- angular-w-bootstrap: small application to test integrations with Bootstrap CSS framework and study Angular attribute directives.
- angular-w-tailwind: small application to test integrations with Tailwind CSS framework and DaisyUI.
- microfrontend: a demo application with dynamic loading of microfrontend applications.

💪 My current efforts are on these:
- 🚧angular-demo🚧: application to study Angular 17. Be careful, it's a work in progress: take one of these: ⛑️ ⛑️ ⛑️

Others:

- training-ground: not a real project, but a repo containing my notes and experiments while studying. Probably I will keep this private.
- new repositories soon 😊

## Personal interests

- 🎲 GURPS: a set of RPG rules from GURPS system, to be used in couple with "The Silence of Hollowind" settings.
