# Let me introduce myself!

- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @syrenly.
- ðŸŒ¸ I'm a frontend developer, with focus on Angular.
- ðŸŒ± I'm trying to create projects with Angular on GitHub, to improve my skills.
- ðŸ¥° I like to share knowledge and learn new stuff.
- ðŸ¤— You are welcome to stay here and study with me ðŸ¤—

# My Repositories
- angular-17: a list of small projects that I'm generating to study the latest news of the framework (and integration with other tools).
- microfrontend: a demo application with dynamic loading of microfrontend applications.
- training-ground: not a real project, but a repo containing my notes and experiments while studying. Probably I will keep this private.
- new repositories soon ðŸ˜Š
