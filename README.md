# Please, let me introduce myself!

- 👋 Hi, I’m @syrenly.
- 🌸 I'm a frontend developer, with focus on Angular.
- 🌱 I'm trying to create projects with Angular on GitHub, to improve my skills.
- 🥰 I like to share knowledge and learn new stuff.
- 🤗 If you make my point, you are welcome 🤗

# My Repositories
- angular-17: a list of small projects that I'm generating to study the latest news of the framework (and integration with other tools).
- training-ground: not a real project, but a repo containing my notes and experiments while studying. Probably I will take this private.
